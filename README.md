# hyperskill_encryptDecrypt

<h2>Stage 1</h2>
<p>Learn to input the data and encrypt it, replacing the letters. </p>
<p>For the first stage, you need to manually encrypt the message "we found a treasure!" and print only the ciphertext (in lower case).
   
   To encrypt the message, replace each letter with the letter that is in the corresponding position from the end of the English alphabet (a→z, b→y, c→x, ... x→c, y →b, z→a). Do not replace spaces or the exclamation mark.
   
   Use the given template to your program to print the ciphertext instead of the original message.
   
   The output should look like ## ##### # ########! where # is a lower-case English letter.</p>

<h2>Stage 2</h2>
<p>Learn to encrypt messages with a numeric key, using the Caesar cypher.  </p>

<h2>Stage 3</h2>
<p>Encrypting a message is only half of the deal: now learn to decrypt it as well, using a standard Unicode table. </p>

<h2>Stage 4</h2>
<p>Practice working with the command line, using it for passing the mode, the key and the string. </p>

<h2>Stage 5</h2>
<p>Work with files: learn to store your data in a file.  </p>

<h2>Stage 6</h2>
<p>Add the possibility to choose a specific encryption algorithm: Ceasar or Unicode. </p>
